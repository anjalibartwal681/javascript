Yes, JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. In a dynamically typed language, variable types are determined and checked at runtime, as opposed to statically typed languages where types are checked at compile-time.

In JavaScript, you can use the var, let, or const keywords to declare variables without specifying their types explicitly. The type of a variable is dynamically inferred based on the value it holds. Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
let myVariable = 42;  // myVariable is dynamically assigned the type "number"
console.log(myVariable);

myVariable = "Hello, world!";  // Now myVariable is dynamically assigned the type "string"
console.log(myVariable);
In this example, myVariable starts as a number and then is assigned a string value. JavaScript allows this kind of flexibility in assigning values of different types to the same variable.

The dynamic typing nature of JavaScript provides flexibility but also requires careful handling of types to avoid unexpected behavior. It's important to be aware of the types of values in your code and how they may interact, especially in larger and more complex applications
