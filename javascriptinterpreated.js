javascript is interpreated language  it execute code line by line  but having   modern js engine v8 engine used in google chrome  and node js  use a combination of interpertation and compilation
to improve performance of javascript  execution  time.
  Interpretation: The JavaScript engine initially interprets the source code line by line. This allows for quick startup and execution of the code.

Compilation: Many modern JavaScript engines employ Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation. Instead of interpreting the entire code upfront, the engine may 
  analyze the code and convert parts of it into machine code just before they are executed. This compiled machine code can be executed more efficiently than the original source code.

Optimizations: JavaScript engines also perform various optimizations to improve the execution speed. This may include inlining functions, eliminating dead code, 
    and applying other techniques to enhance the overall performance of the code.
