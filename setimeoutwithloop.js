Apologies for any confusion. The difference in output is related to how let and var handle variable scoping in JavaScript.

If you use let in your loop, each iteration creates a new scope for the variable i. This means that each iteration of the loop has its own separate i variable, and closures created by the setTimeout function capture the correct value of i for that specific iteration:

javascript
Copy code
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000 * i);
}
In this case, the output will be 0, 1, and 2 with a delay between each log.

However, if you use var instead of let, the variable i is hoisted to the function scope, and there is only one variable i shared across all iterations of the loop. Consequently, all the setTimeout callbacks capture and reference the same variable i, leading to the output of "3" for all three callbacks:
