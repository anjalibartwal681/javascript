what is class

ChatGPT
In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of properties and methods that will be common to all objects instantiated from that class. Objects created from a class are instances of that class.

Here are key concepts associated with classes:

Properties: Also known as attributes or fields, properties are the characteristics or data members associated with a class. They define the state of an object.

Methods: Methods are functions or procedures associated with a class. They define the behavior of the objects created from the class.

Objects: An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete realization of the class blueprint, with specific values for its properties.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (properties) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It hides the internal details of the object and provides an interface for interacting with it.

Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism where a class can inherit properties and methods from another class. It promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchy of classes.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent various types of objects.

Here's a simple example in JavaScript:

javascript
Copy code
class Animal {
  constructor(name, sound) {
    this.name = name;
    this.sound = sound;
  }

  makeSound() {
    console.log(`${this.name} says ${this.sound}`);
  }
}

// Creating objects (instances) from the class
const cat = new Animal("Cat", "Meow");
const dog = new Animal("Dog", "Woof");

// Using methods of the class
cat.makeSound(); // Output: Cat says Meow
dog.makeSound(); // Output: Dog says Woof
