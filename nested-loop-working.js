In the provided code:
// 12345
// 12345
// 12345
// 12345
// 12345


javascript
Copy code
let str = "";
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j <= 5; j++) {
        str += j;
    }
    str += '\n';
}
console.log(str);
The inner loop for j will terminate when j reaches the condition specified in its loop statement, which is j <= 5. As soon as j becomes 6 (after the fifth iteration), the condition j <= 5 becomes false, and the inner loop exits.

In this case, the inner loop runs for each value of i in the outer loop (from 1 to 5), and for each iteration of the inner loop, j takes values from 1 to 5. Once j reaches 6, the inner loop exits, and the outer loop continues with the next value of i until it completes all iterations.

Therefore, the inner loop terminates when j becomes greater than 5.
