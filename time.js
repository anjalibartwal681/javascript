I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. I misspoke in that statement. To clarify:

With var, the variable i is hoisted to the enclosing function scope, or the global scope if there is no function. This means that there is only one variable i shared across all iterations of the loop, and its value gets updated during each iteration. The closure created by the setTimeout function captures the reference to this shared variable i.

Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000);
}
In this case, the output will be "3" printed three times because when the setTimeout callbacks are executed, they reference the same i, which has been updated to 3 after the loop finishes.

Contrastingly, with let, a new variable i is created for each iteration of the loop, and each closure captures a reference to its own distinct i:
